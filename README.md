# k6 extension catalogs

This repository contains various auto-generated k6 extension catalogs. The source of the generation is the [extensions.json](https://github.com/grafana/k6-docs/blob/main/src/data/doc-extensions/extensions.json) k6 extension registry file of the [grafana/k6-docs](https://github.com/grafana/k6-docs/) repository.

The following catalogs are automatically updated:
- [registered.json](https://grafana.github.io/k6-extension-catalogs/registered.json) contains all registered extensions
- [official.json](https://grafana.github.io/k6-extension-catalogs/official.json) contains officially supported extensions
- [cloud.json](https://grafana.github.io/k6-extension-catalogs/cloud.json) contains extensions available in the cloud

The generated catalogs are automatically deployed to GitHub pages (the links above point to the GitHub pages site).
